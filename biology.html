It is also known under the common names “Busuanga jungle toad”, “Philippine aquatic frog”, “Busuanga disk-tongued toad”, and “Busuanga discoglossid frog” (the last two names reflect the earlier placement of the genus Barbourula in the family Discoglossidae, but are misleading under current taxonomy). It is endemic to the Busuanga, Culion, Balabac, and Palawan islands in the Philippines. Its natural habitats are tropical dryforests, moist lowland forests, moist montane forests, rivers, and intermittent rivers. It is threatened by habitat loss.<br><br>

The <strong>Philippine flying lemur</strong> (<i>Cynocephalus volans</i>), known locally as the kagwang, is one of two species of flying lemurs, the only two living species in the order Dermoptera. Additionally, it is the only member of the genus Cynocephalus. The other species is the Sunda flying lemur. Recent research from genetic analysis suggests two other species, the Bornean flying lemur and the Javan flying lemur, may exist, as well, but they have yet to be officially classified so. Although called a flying lemur, it cannot fly and is not a lemur. Both species of Dermoptera are classified under the superorder Euarchonta which includes the Scandentia and the primates, as well as an extinct order of mammals, the Plesiadapiformes.<br>

                        But the opposite is true. Through the years, many of these Mindoro crocodiles – endemic only to the Philippines – have disappeared falling prey to relentless hunters.

                        <br><br>This turtle may have gotten a misnomer as it is totally not endemic to the island of Leyte but only in the Palawan island group.<br>

                        You can easily distinguish this land turtle by its ginkgo-shaped vertebral scutes (at its back). Also, a line which is colored pale white to yellow traverses across its head behind the ears.<br>

                        They are prized as pets and ranks as one of the most commonly confiscated species in the Philippines with overseas buyers visiting the islands to collect them. However, sadly, the Philippine forest turtle do not do well in captivity making them avery vulnerable species.<br><br>

                        However by some twist of fate, this mega bat specie known for its naked appearance due to the wings attachment on the midline of their back, made an amazing recovery. Reported to be extinct in 1970’s, the night-flier known to very equipped at biting through hard-skinned fruits making them extremely unpopular to farmers, were rediscovered, though in small numbers by the 2000’s.<br>

                        Fortunately, Cebu forests where this bat is endemic to is protected by law. Negros may do well to follow suit. <br><br>

                        <h2> Frog Dissection </h2>

                        <p><br><br>Procedure: <br><br>

                        Put on safety goggles, gloves, and a lab apron.      
                        Place a frog on a dissection tray. To determine the frog’s sex, look at the hand digits, or fingers, on its forelegs. A male frog usually has thick pads on its "thumbs,” which is one external difference between the sexes, as shown in the diagram below. Male frogs are also usually smaller than female frogs. Observe several frogs to see the difference between males and females.<br><br><br>




                         Use the diagram below to locate and identify the external features of the head. Find the mouth, external nares, tympani, eyes, and nictitating membranes.<br><br>


                        Turn the frog on its back and pin down the legs. Cut the hinges of the mouth and open it wide. Use the diagram below to locate and identify the structures inside the mouth. Use a probe to help find each part: the vomerine teeth, the maxillary teeth, the internal nares, the tongue, the openings to the Eustachian tubes, the esophagus, the pharynx, and the slit-like glottis.<br><br>


                        Look for the opening to the frog’s cloaca, located between the hind legs. Use forceps to lift the skin and use scissors to cut along the center of the body from the cloaca to the lip. Turn back the skin, cut toward the side at each leg, and pin the skin flat. The diagram above shows how to make these cuts
                        Lift and cut through the muscles and breast bone to open up the body cavity. If your frog is a female, the abdominal cavity may be filled with dark-colored eggs. If so, remove the eggs on one side so you can see the organs underlying them.<br><br>
                        Use the diagram below to locate and identify the organs of the digestive system: esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, cloaca, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.<br><br><br>

                         






                        Again refer to the diagram below to identify the parts of the circulatory and respiratory systems that are in the chest cavity. Find the left atrium, right atrium, and ventricle of the heart. Find an artery attached to the heart and another artery near the backbone. Find a vein near one of the shoulders. Find the two lungs.<br><br><br>


                        Use a probe and scissors to lift and remove the intestines and liver. Use the diagram on the next page to identify the parts of the urinary and reproductive systems. Remove the peritoneal membrane, which is connective tissue that lies on top of the red kidneys. Observe the yellow fat bodies that are attached to the kidneys. Find the ureters; the urinary bladder; the testes and sperm ducts in the male; and the ovaries, oviducts, and uteri in the female.<br><br><br>


                        Remove the kidneys and look for threadlike spinal nerves that extend from the spinal cord. Dissect a thigh, and trace one nerve into a leg muscle. Note the size and texture of the leg muscles.<br><br>
                        Dispose of your materials according to the directions from your teacher.<br><br>
                        Clean up your work area and wash your hands before leaving the lab.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
